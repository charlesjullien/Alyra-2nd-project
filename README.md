# Alyra-2nd-project

copy-paste this file into the test/ folder of an hardhat project with the alyra official Voting.sol SC.

This is a unit test javascript file for the https://github.com/lecascyril/CodesRinkeby/blob/main/voting.sol SC.

I did my unit tests in a quite basic way... simply following the stages of the Workflow from the SC.

I created sample users to do my tests : bob, alice, pamela and jonny. The Owner is called deployer.
